# Hyrule Town Hall
## A Mido's House Fork

This is the source code for <https://hth.zeldaspeedruns.com/>, a platform for organizing speedrunning and randomizer events like tournaments and community races. It integrates with other platforms to automate some aspects of event management, including:

* [racetime.gg](https://racetime.gg/) (creating official and practice race rooms, handling chat commands, handling results and [FPA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQd3S28r8SOBy-4C5Lxeu6nFAYpWgQqN9lCEKhLGTT3zcaXDSKj0iUnZv6UPo_GargUVQx5F-wOPUtJ/pub) calls)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/) (creating scheduling threads, handling commands for scheduling and settings drafting, posting results, notifying organizers when their attention is needed)
* [start.gg](https://start.gg/) (handling matchups, reporting results)

Hyrule Town Hall is custom-built in close cooperation with event organizers to allow it to work with the features that make each event unique. It is a fork of Mido's House created by Fenhl.
